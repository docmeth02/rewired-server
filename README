Welcome to re:wired, the reinvented wired Server.

WARNING:
This is a alpha release of the re:wired server software.
For now it is a almost feature complete wired v1 server without much error checking and testing!

Please report any error to docmeth02@googlemail.com or connect to the development server at wired://re-wired.info
